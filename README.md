My project is called Wanderly, and app that lets the user "Wander Around The World". It is a travel planner app that hopes to relief the stress of planning activities while we travel.  This app allows user to explore a specific destination they would like to travel to. Once the city is selected, the app will generate a list of activities based off of user preferences, where then can be saved to the Bucket List Dashboard. Here in the Dashboard, users can view their saved city activities and plan their trip based off of it.
